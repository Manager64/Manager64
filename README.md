ðŸ‘€ - Examples of one of my scripts:

This script is a game framework loader which loads each script to each child of game; e.g: ReplicatedStorage. The PackageLink contains an src folder with all the classes in it, and a ModuleScript for dependencies. And inside the PackageLinked Script, is has a Source which requires modules from every part of the game, which is the Shared, Client, and Server Sided. It is quite complicated, but the screenshot below will have an example.
